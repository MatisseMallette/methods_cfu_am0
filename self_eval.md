# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
>In terms of the *concept* of methods, I feel fine. What I don't feel fine with are some of the naming decisions for certain built-in methods. For example, the take method returns some number of elements from the beginning of an Array. HOWEVER, it doesn't actually CHANGE the Array that calls it. To me, `array1.push(array2.take[3])` means you will TAKE 3 elements away from the beginning of 'array2` and PUSH them onto the end of array1.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
> I feel very confident.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
> Why are they called methods and not functions? Nah just kidding, but I really can't think of a question. Anything I can think of, I can either experiment and find out for myself, or look it up.
